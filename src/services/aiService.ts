This analysis identifies recurring patterns in behavior, triggers, and responses.

## Sleep Patterns
- Consistent bedtime routine leads to better sleep quality
- Difficulty falling asleep on days with screen time within 1 hour of bedtime
- Naps longer than 2 hours disrupt nighttime sleep

## Eating Patterns
- Most receptive to new foods at lunch time
- More likely to eat vegetables when they're served first, before other foods
- Shows food refusal more often when tired

## Emotional Regulation Patterns
- Meltdowns most commonly occur during transitions between activities
- Early warning signs include increased physical movement and raised voice
- Most effective intervention: 5-minute warning before transitions + visual timer

## Recommendations Based on Patterns
1. Maintain consistent daily schedule with visual supports
2. Implement 5-minute warnings before all transitions
3. Ensure at least 1 hour of outdoor physical activity daily
4. Schedule sensory breaks throughout the day`;
